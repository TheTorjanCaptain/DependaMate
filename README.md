## 🔑 GitHub Token Setup

To use **DependaMate**, you'll need a **GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)** with appropriate scopes or repository permissions depending on the type of token you use.

---

### ✅ Required Scopes (for **Classic Tokens**):
- `repo` – to read repository data and security alerts  
- `read:org` *(optional but recommended)* – if you're accessing organization-level private repositories

---

### ✅ Required Permissions (for **Fine-Grained Tokens**):
Assign the following **repository permissions** when generating a fine-grained token:

| Permission         | Access Level |
|--------------------|--------------|
| Dependabot alerts  | Read         |
| Contents           | Read         |
| Metadata *(optional)* | Read     |

---

### 🔐 Authorize Token for SSO (if applicable)

If you're part of a **GitHub organization that enforces SSO (Single Sign-On)**, just setting the scopes is **not enough**. You must **explicitly authorize the token** for access.

#### Steps:
1. Go to your [GitHub Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Find your newly created token
3. Click **"Enable SSO"**
4. Authorize it for the required organization(s)

Once you have the token ready and authorized, you can use it with DependaMate to fetch and manage Dependabot alerts securely and efficiently.
